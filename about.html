		<p>I am a software developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
<p>I'm a generalist programmer with skills ranging from infrastructre to
front-end development. That said, I spend most of my time in the
back-end. I have a particular interest in functional programming, but
also have a strong background in more traditional imperative
approaches.</p>
<p>I'm a long-time Linux enthusiast. These days all my machines run
NixOS, but I've run Arch, Ubuntu, Fedora, and more over the decades. I
believe strongly in the importance of open-source software.</p>
<p>A good deal of my free time is spent on personal programming or
computer projects. Most of these can be found on Github.</p>
<p>I also have a longstanding interest in (human) language. I completed
a BA in theoretical linguistics, during which my chief interests were
syntactic theory, prosody, and sociolinguistics. I've studied many
languages over the years, with particular focus on Japanese, Icelandic
and Irish. These days I'm mainly trying to speak passable Danish.</p>
