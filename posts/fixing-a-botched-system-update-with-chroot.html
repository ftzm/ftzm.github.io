    <h1> Fixing a Botched System Update Without Chroot </h1>
    <p>When you find yourself unable to login to a Linux installation to fix
it from within, chroot is usually the answer—but not always. Here I show
how to repair a broken Arch Linux system upgrade without chroot.</p>
<p>The other day I erroneously ran an incomplete upgrade to the <a
href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> installation on my
laptop, which resulted in my system running an upgraded ncurses package
with an outdated bash package. Bash is very much dependent on ncurses,
so when I next tried to boot up I found myself unable to log in, instead
being sent back to the username prompt at every attempt. My first
reaction was that I would have to boot up with external media and <a
href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Change_root">chroot</a> into
the system to complete the update. In some 8 years of using Arch I've
managed to avoid such calamity, but from my reading on the forums the
first chroot seems almost rite of passage. So I wrote the latest arch
iso to a spare usb, booted up, mounted my filesystem...and hit a wall at
the chroot. I found that I could no more chroot into my system than log
in; bash was broken, so nothing worked. Which really should have been
obvious from the start.</p>
<p>But no matter. A quick bit of research revealed that the solution to
my problem was <a
href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman">Pacman's</a> "--root"
option. Forget chrooting--just mount the on-disk filesystem and run
pacman in the external media shell, specifying that the disk filesystem
is to be used as the root filesystem. This is really as simple as the
following two commands:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> mount /dev/sdxX /mnt/something</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> pacman <span class="at">--root</span> /dev/something <span class="at">--cachedir</span><span class="op">=</span>/mnt/something/var/cache/pacman/pkg <span class="at">-Syu</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here xX represents the specific disk and partition of your root
filesystem. The --cachedir option tells pacman to save downloaded
packages on-disk as well, which one will likely want to do either for
the ability to downgrade packages later or simply because the external
media lacks space.</p>
<p>The above worked perfectly for me, and my system was up and running
within minutes. At my current rate it'll be another 8 years before I'll
need this information again, but hopefully this information will help
someone else in the meantime.</p>
